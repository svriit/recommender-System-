# Recommender System Enhancement Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to improve recommender systems by addressing the challenges of the "cold start" problem and data sparsity. Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques are used to enhance recommendation accuracy and provide more relevant item suggestions.

## Key Features
- **Cold Start Mitigation:** The project includes techniques to handle new users and items with limited historical data.
- **Data Sparsity:** The system efficiently deals with sparse user-item interaction data.
- **User-Item Similarity:** A user-item similarity matrix is generated to capture preferences and relationships.
- **Prediction Matrix:** A prediction matrix estimates user preferences for unrated items.

## Approaches Used
### Memory-Based CF Approaches
1. KNNBasic
2. KNNBaseline
3. KNNWithMeans
4. SVD
5. SVD++

### Model-Based CF Approach
- Co-Clustering

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [Surprise](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommender-system-enhancement.git
    cd recommender-system-enhancement
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn scikit-surprise
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it follows the expected format.
2. Execute the CF algorithms of your choice from the provided code files.
3. Evaluate the results, focusing on recommendation accuracy, error rates, and addressing cold start issues.

```bash
python knn_baseline.py
python co_clustering.py
# Add commands for other approaches as needed
